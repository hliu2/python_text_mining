# Python Text Mining Project 
## Introduction
* Wrote a text classification pipeline to classify movie reviews as either positive or
negative, found a good set of parameters using grid search and evaluated the performance
of test set. 
* Deeply explored the min_df and max_df of TfidfVectorizer and ngram_range parameter of
TfidfVectorizer
* Tried PCA and Factor Analysis to separate negative and positive reviews in a two dimensional plot for visualization  
* Technologies used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Data Source
* movie reviews from the v2.0 polarity dataset comes from the http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data
