# Python Text Mining Project 
## Introduction
* Wrote a text classification pipeline to classify movie reviews as either positive or
negative, found a good set of parameters using grid search and evaluated the performance
of test set. 
* Deeply explored the min_df and max_df of TfidfVectorizer and ngram_range parameter of
TfidfVectorizer
* Tried PCA and Factor Analysis to separate negative and positive reviews in a two dimensional plot for visualization
